# Machine Learning System Design

This repository is dedicated to Machine Learning System Design, featuring end-to-end examples and partially based on [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-system-design). While it doesn't offer a comprehensive teaching experience like the book, it provides a structure and a variety of design documents for your use.
