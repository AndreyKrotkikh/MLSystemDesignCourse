# Machine Learning System Design

This repository is dedicated to Machine Learning System Design, featuring end-to-end examples and partially based on [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-system-design). While it doesn't offer a comprehensive teaching experience like the book, it provides a structure and a variety of design documents for your use. Feedback and contributions of design documents for public use are welcomed.

In the BookOutline.md you can find an overall structure we think is needed (but not limited to) for a proper design doc. Each chapter provides an outline from the book mentioned above, and starting from chapter 2, it can be read as a quick reminder of what needs to be integrated into the design document and why.

In the Design_Doc_Examples, you can find examples of design documents and use them as templates for your projects. Please feel free to contribute.
