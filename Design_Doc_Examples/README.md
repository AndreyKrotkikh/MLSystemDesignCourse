# ML System Design Examples

This directory contains various ML system design documents organized into three categories:

## Directory Structure

```
├── Mock/                  # Educational mock examples
│   └── EN/               # English mock examples
├── Examples/             # Real-world inspired examples
│   └── EN/              # English examples
└── Real/                # Actual production design docs
    └── EN/              # English real examples
```

## Categories

### Mock Documents
Located in `Mock/` directory. These are educational examples created specifically for learning purposes. They demonstrate best practices and common patterns but may use fictional companies or simplified scenarios.

### Example Documents
Located in `Examples/` directory. These are based on real-world scenarios but may be adapted or modified for educational purposes. They maintain realistic complexity while being accessible for learning.

### Real Documents
Located in `Real/` directory. These are actual production design documents from real projects (with sensitive information removed). They show how ML systems are designed in practice.

## Language Organization

Each category has language-specific subdirectories:
- `EN/` for English documents
- Additional language folders can be added as needed

## Contributing

When adding new design documents:
1. Choose the appropriate category (Mock/Examples/Real)
2. Place in the correct language subdirectory
3. Follow the template from `templates/basic_ml_design_doc.md`
4. Include all necessary diagrams and supporting files
5. Update this README if adding new language folders
